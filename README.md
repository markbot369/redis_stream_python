# Making a Redis Stream Client Example in Python

## Introduction

Microservice architecture has become a popular approach to developing software applications that are scalable, maintainable, and flexible. One of the challenges of microservice architecture is managing the flow of data between services, which can become complex as the number of services and interactions between them grows.

One solution to this challenge is to use message queues to decouple services, allowing them to communicate asynchronously and reducing the risk of service failures and downtime. Redis streams are a type of message queue that are particularly well-suited for microservice architecture.

Redis streams allow multiple producers to write messages to a stream, which can then be read by multiple consumers. This allows services to communicate in a scalable and efficient way, with messages being delivered in the order they are received. Redis streams also support message acknowledgment and automatic message retention, making it easy to implement reliable message processing in microservices.

In this article, we'll explore how to use Python and the aioredis module to connect to a Redis stream and write to a defined queue. We'll demonstrate how to encapsulate this functionality in a Python class, and how to make it into a CLI application with command-line arguments. By the end of this article, you'll have a better understanding of how to use Redis streams in your own microservice architecture projects.

## Redis Stream Client

## Redis Stream Client Example

In this code, we define a Python class called RedisService that encapsulates the functionality for connecting to a Redis instance, reading from a stream, and writing to a queue. The constructor of this class takes four arguments, `stream_name` and `queue_name`, which define the Redis stream and queue to use, and `server` and `port` for define the redis server and corresponding IP port to connect.

The following code shows the init method of the RedisService class:

```python
from redis import asyncio as aioredis


class RedisService:
    """Base Redis service class that's connects to a Redis stream server."""
    def __init__(self, stream_name, queue_name,
                 server: str = 'localhost',
                 port: int = 6379):
        self._stream_name = stream_name
        self._queue_name = queue_name
        self._localhost = server
        self._port = port
        self._redis_db = None
```

To connect to Redis, the `connect_to_redis` method uses the aioredis module to create a Redis connection pool. This method is called when the start method is called, which starts the service by connecting to Redis and starting to read from the stream.

```python
async def connect_to_redis(self):
    self._redis_db = await aioredis.create_redis_pool(
        f'redis://{self._localhost}:{self._port}'
    )
```

The `read_from_stream` method is an asynchronous loop that reads from the Redis stream indefinitely. When a new message is received, it is printed to the console, and then written to the Redis queue using the `write_to_queue` method. This method uses the `lpush` command to push a message onto the head of the queue.

```python
async def write_to_queue(self, message):
    await self._redis_db.lpush(self._queue_name, message)


async def read_from_stream(self):
    while True:
        message = await self._redis_db.xread(
            [self._stream_name],
            latest_ids=['>'],
            count=1,
            timeout=0
        )
        print(f'Received message from stream: {message}')
        await self.write_to_queue(message)
```

Finally we define a start method that starts the service by connecting to Redis and starting to read from the stream.

```python
async def start(self):
    await self.connect_to_redis()
    await self.read_from_stream()
```

## Redis Stream Server

To make this code into a CLI application, we use the argparse module to parse command-line arguments. The parse_arguments function defines two optional arguments, `--stream` and `--queue`, with default values of mystream and myqueue, respectively. The main function calls parse_arguments to retrieve the command-line arguments, and then creates an instance of the RedisService class with these arguments.

Finally, we use the `asyncio.run` function to run the main function asynchronously. This allows the service to run indefinitely, reading from the Redis stream and writing to the queue.
